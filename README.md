# ProjektiWeb - Library Management System

## Introduction
Welcome to the **Library Management System** project! This web application is designed to facilitate the efficient management of a library, allowing users to **sign up**, **browse**, **purchase books**, and even **save their favorite selections**. It combines the power of **ReactJS** on the frontend with **.NET** on the backend to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience.

## Features
Our system comes equipped with a wide range of features to enhance the library experience:

- **User Registration**: Users can create accounts with their personal details, making it easy to track their activities.

- **Book Catalog**: Browse and search for books in the library's collection.

- **Book Details**: Access detailed information about each book, including the author, publication date, and genre.

- **Purchase Books**: Users can add books to their cart and proceed to make purchases securely.

- **Favorite Books**: Save favorite books to a dedicated section for quick access.

- **Admin Panel**: An admin interface to manage books, user accounts, and transactions.

## Technologies Used
This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: Developed using **ReactJS**, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. ReactJS provides a dynamic and interactive experience for users, making the application responsive and fast.

- **Backend**: Powered by **.NET**, a robust and versatile framework for building scalable and secure web applications. .NET ensures the reliability and performance of the server-side operations.
