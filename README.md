- **Frontend**: Developed using **ReactJS**, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. ReactJS provides a dynamic and interactive experience for users, making the application responsive and fast.

- **Backend**: Powered by **.NET**, a robust and versatile framework for building scalable and secure web applications. .NET ensures the reliability and performance of the server-side operations.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Setup the Backend**: Navigate to the `backend` directory and follow the instructions in the backend README to set up the .NET server.

3. **Setup the Frontend**: Navigate to the `frontend` directory and follow the instructions in the frontend README to configure the ReactJS application.

4. **Database Configuration**: Configure the database with your preferred database management system, ensuring it's connected to the backend.

5. **Run the Application**: Start both the frontend and backend servers, and you're ready to explore and test the library management system!

## Conclusion
This **Library Management System** project brings together **ReactJS** and **.NET** to offer a sophisticated, user-friendly, and feature-rich platform for managing libraries. Whether you're a student, a book enthusiast, or a library administrator, this system will help you manage and access books with ease.
